This is an App that uses the CLI to ask the user some questions to build out sandwhich trays.  The front end is some simple questions using the inquirer package, and the backend uses mysql to hold the values that the user has choosen.

On execution of the *node bamazon.js* the user has three choices.

![First](https://github.com/olsonathan/bamazon/blob/master/assets/first.PNG)
 

Make a sandwhich tray--runs the user through the app.

Choosing *Make a sandwhich tray* will start the user being asked questions about the type of Bread, Meat, Vegtables, Cheese, and Condiments that they would like for their sandwhich tray.
